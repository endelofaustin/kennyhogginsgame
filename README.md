Kenny is a pig. He likes being a pig. And a hog. Letâ€™s go for a jog.


Pig will jump on platform. There will be input and a game loop and sprites

## Game engine design

 * ### The main graphics and update loops
    * #### Update loop stuff
      * The update loop happens 120 times per second. Pyglet calls our
        `main_update_callback` function in `main.py` 120 times per second.
      * The `main_update_callback` looks at a list of all objects in the game
        that need updating, and calls their update functions.
      * Then if any of them have marked themselves for deletion, it deletes them.
 * ### Sprites and the Player object
 * ### Physics, actions and events
 * ### The EngineGlobals static object
 * ### Blocks and map components
 * ### Editing and pickling of maps
