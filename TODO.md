TODO LIST:
* Maps
   * ~~Be able to use different 32-pixel-square tiles in the maps~~
   * ~~When we save the map we get a ValueError because pickle cannot pickle pointers~~
   * We now have the ability to build out different types of Blocks upon which to jump!
* ~~Projectiles~~
   * ~~Create a projectile class that subclasses a Pyglet Sprite, but with different mechanics than the PhysicsSprite~~
   * We now can shoot! (in one direction) with a spitting noise
* Kenny should be able to face left as well
* Enemies & sprite movement
* Placement of sprites & solid objects in the environment
* Saving/serializing the map to and from a file - pickle?
   * We may want to keep track of different versions of the map class over time
* Characters / sprites
* Pixel art plugin
* Storyline
* Crawling text intro
* Menus & configuration
* Serialization / save games

VILLAIN ROSTER:
* Pippi Longstocking, vegan animal hater
* Levod Burtim, rainbow farting space engineer

OTHER PEEPS:
* Ronald McSwanson, life coach and dispenser of wisdom

COOL IDEAS:
* What if part of the game was having to fix a bad level design so that you could complete it
* One huge map but parts of it change when you're not looking
* Random text in the background like a poem or Kenny's thoughts
